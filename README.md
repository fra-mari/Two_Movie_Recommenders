* Build a movie recommender website using 'MovieLens' Dataset
* Two recommender models has been used for providing the recommendations
    + 1. Collaborative Filtering With Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
    + 2. Item-based Collaborative Filtering (find similar movies instead of similar users) using CSR matrix and KNN with 'cosine similarity' as the method

### How To Use This Code
#### On UNIX Systems

If you use MacOs or Linux, clone this repository and `cd` into the folder `recommender_app`. Then follow these simple steps:
1. Install the required Python libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Generate the trained models by running `python movie_recommender.py`. The process may take a few minutes, but the module also takes care of starting the webapp once the training phase:
   - When you Terminal prints `Now starting the Flask app`, open the address `http://localhost:5000` in your browser for using the webapp, then **follow the instructions on the CLI** to decide whether to enable the automatic retraining of the models based on the ratings provided by the app's users or not.<small><br>Â <br>**Note**: on some Linux versions, you may need to `apt install lsof` before running the `movie_recommender`module.</small>
3. Once the files containing the model generated, you can always access the webapp running `python movies_app.py`.

**P.S.**: If you prefer to `Docker`, just follow the instructions in the following paragraph.



#### On Windows
You may recur to `WSL`, but the simplest way is probably to use `Docker`. All you have to do is:

- `cd` into the folder `recommender_app`.

- Build the image from the provided Dockerfile by running `docker build . -t movies`.

- Create and start a container by running `docker run -ti -p 5000:5000 --name recommender movies`. You will get access to the container's Bash Command Line.

- Run `python movie_recommender.py`. <u>Refer to point 2 of the previous paragraph</u> for the next steps and options. The webapp will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

- To quit the container's environment and CLI, you may use the command `exit`.
